# TODO List
This is a creative rails project!

submit a link to your Github repo that contains a README on Github listing the project's contributors, summary, users, and the MVP description.

Contributors: Nithya Deepak and Eleanor (Nell) White

## Summary
TODO is a shared, web-based app to help you create and share lists with your friends and family! It allows you and others to share one list, that you can access at anytime through the cloud! You can create items, delete them when you are finished, and see them easily at any time. You can use this app to plan projects with your peers and coordinate with the team, or you can plan what you need to buy for a casual get-together.


## Users

Our users would be people of all ages who are trying to plan or collaborate on something. Our app aims to make collaborative lists easy to access. For example, some of our users could be students working on a software development project, or even a family trying to plan a birthday party.


## MVP Description

Our MVP will be a web-based app to allow groups to make lists. All users who visit the app should be able to access all features listed below:

- Able to add items
- Able to delete items
- Able to view items

## Functionality

There will be three pages on our app: the homepage with the list of items, the create new item page, and the view details page.

The homepage will have show the users' current list, with an option to delete individual items, an option to view details of the project and an option to create a new item. The create new item page will allow you to create a new item on the list. The details page will allow you to see the details of what you have entered as your task.
